#summary Flags for getting IR in ICC and GCC are described here.

= ICC =

To dump IR in ICC use the following command line:
{{{
icc <your src-file> -mP2OPT_il0_print=<num>
}}}
where _num_ is a phase number.<br>
*Stderr* is used as the output stream.<br>
<br>
If _num_ = -1 then the dump will be printed after each phase.<br>
Phase numbering isn't successive, the numbers of phases seem to be chosen at random.<br>
<br>
Numbers of the most useful phases:
  * 6    - after building CFG
  * 2510 - after some optimizations.
<br>
= GCC =
To dump IR in GCC use the following command line:
{{{
gcc <your src-file> -df
}}}
The output will be in src-file.cfg
