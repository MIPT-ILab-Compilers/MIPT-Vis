= Introduction =

This document lists conventions for various aspects of C/C++ coding in our project. In order to maintain code readable and ease writing project members should follow these propositions or add their own suggestions. What we want to achieve is a clear, simple code that should be easy to understand by all project members. Code should look familiar to those who are reading it for the first time. This can be achieved by maintaining uniform style through all of the source files.
