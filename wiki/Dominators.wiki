#summary Some info about dominators, postdominators, dominance frontier (DF) and iterated DF
=Dominators, postdominators, dominance frontier=

    1) A flowgraph _G = (V, A, r)_ is a directed graph with |_V_| = n vertices and |_A_| = m edges such that every vertex is reachable from a distinguished root vertex _r_ from _V_ .
A vertex _w_ *dominates* a vertex _v_ if every path from _r_ to _v_ includes _w_. Our goal
is to find the set *Dom(v)* of all vertices that dominate _v_ for each vertex _v_ from _V_.
Certain applications require computing of the *postdominators* for _G_, defined as the
dominators in the graph obtained from _G_ by reversing the orientation of each edge.

    2) A node _d_ *strictly dominates* a node _n_ if _d_ dominates _n_ and _d_ does not equal _n_.

    3) The *immediate dominator* or idom of a node _n_ is the unique node that strictly dominates _n_ but does not strictly dominate any other node that strictly dominates _n_.

    4) The *dominance frontier* of a node _n_ is the set of all nodes _w_ such that _n_ dominates a predecessor of _w_, but _n_ does not strictly dominate _w_. 
{{{
(DF(S) = sum( x from S) of DF(x)
}}}

    5) A node _z_ *post-dominates* node _n_ if after going through _n_, you're always going to go through _z_.

    6) A *dominator tree* is a tree in which each node's children are those nodes that it immediately dominates. As the immediate dominator is unique, it is a tree. The start node is the top of the tree.

    7) The dominator of the start node is the start node itself. The set of dominators for any other node _n_ is the intersection of the set of dominators for all predecessors _p_ of _n_. The node _n_ is also in the set of dominators for _n_.

    8) *Iterated dominance* frontier: 
{{{
( DF+(S) = lim( i->iternity) of DFi(S)) where 
        DF1(S) = DF(S) DFi+1(S) = DF(S logic+ DFi(S))
}}}
