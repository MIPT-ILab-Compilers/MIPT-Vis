#summary Some info about dominators, postdominators, dominance frontier (DF) and iterated DF
=Dominators, postdominators, dominance frontier=

    1) A flowgraph G = (V,A, r) is a directed graph with |V | = n vertices and |A| = m
arcs such that every vertex is reachable from a distinguished root vertex r 2 V .
A vertex w *dominates* a vertex v if every path from r to v includes w. Our goal
is to find for each vertex v in V the set *Dom(v)* of all vertices that dominate v.
Certain applications require computing the *postdominators* of G, defined as the
dominators in the graph obtained from G by reversing all arc orientations.

    2) A node _d_ *strictly dominates* a node _n_ if _d_ dominates _n_ and _d_ does not equal _n_.

    3) The *immediate dominator* or idom of a node _n_ is the unique node that strictly dominates _n_ but does not strictly dominate any other node that strictly dominates n.

    4) The *dominance frontier* of a node _n_ is the set of all nodes _w_ such that n dominates a predecessor of _w_, but n does not strictly dominate _w_. 
{{{
(DF(S) = sum( x from S) of DF(x)
}}}

    5) A node _z_ *post-dominates* node _n_ if after going through _n_, you're always going to go through _z_.

    6) A *dominator tree* is a tree where each node's children are those nodes it immediately dominates. Because the immediate dominator is unique, it is a tree. The start node is the top of the tree.

    7) The dominator of the start node is the start node itself. The set of dominators for any other node n is the intersection of the set of dominators for all predecessors p of n. The node n is also in the set of dominators for n.

    8) *Iterated dominance* frontier: 
{{{
( DF+(S) = lim( i->iternity) of DFi(S)) where 
        DF1(S) = DF(S) DFi+1(S) = DF(S logic+ DFi(S))
}}}
